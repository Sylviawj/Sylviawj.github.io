        <h3><a id="About Evernote">About Evernote</a></h3>
    <ul>
<li>Evernote is a cloud-based software service designed for creating, organizing and storing various of media files. Whether it’s a text document, a photo, a video, an audio file or even a web page, Evernote keeps all of your stuff stored up in the cloud (as opposed to locally on your computer or mobile device) through your very own personal Evernote account.</li>
     <br></br>
<li>If you're familiar with other popular cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox or Apple's iCloud, then you can sort of think of Evernote as the same kind of service. Evernote, however, is focused more on the creation of notebooks and notes as opposed to uploading files directly from your machine and offers different features that you can't get from other competing services, which is why many users consider it to be their top choice for cloud storage and file management.</li>
 <br></br>
<li>Evernote was founded to address a growing problem that technology helped to create: how to succeed in a world of an ever-increasing volume and velocity of information. Its purpose is to give people the time and freedom to focus on what matters by helping them to live more organized lives.</li>
</ul>
        <h4><a id="How it works">How it works</a></h4> 
<ul>
<li>Sigh up: Create your free account and choose the plan that fits your needs.</li>
     <br></br>
<li>Add content: Type notes, add attachments, clip web pages, or record memos. All in one place.</li>
 <br></br>
<li>Find everything: Organize your way. Use notebooks, tags, or our powerful search to find everything you need quickly.</li>
 <br></br>
<li>Get things done: Manage projects, take meeting notes, set reminders, and edit documents.</li>
  <br></br>
<li>When you upload a file or make a change to an existing file in Evernote on one machine, like your laptop computer, it will sync up all changes across your entire account so even when you access it from a different machine, like your iPhone or tablet computer, everything will already be automatically updated with the changes you previously made. And because it's all stored on servers in the cloud, your files and notes won't take up tons of storage room on your computer or mobile device. You also won't lose anything if any of your machines are damaged.</li>
</ul>

        <h5><a id="Features">Features</a></h5>
        <ul>
<li>Webclipper</li>
            <p> When you find useful information online, clip it to Evernote. Save whole pages or just the parts you want to remember, without the clutter of ads and headlines. No more searching from scratch. No more dead links. Clipped content is always available in your Evernote account, whenever and wherever you need it.</p>
     <br></br>
<li>Multi-Device Sync</li>
<p>Everything you put in Evernote is automatically synced across your computers and devices, and is securely accessible through a web browser. Inspiration can strike anywhere. Begin a note on your phone and finish it on your laptop without losing anything in between.</p>
 <br></br>
<li>Search Handwriting</li>
<p>Find words in handwritten notes, photos of white boards, Post-It® notes, and to-do lists you scan into Evernote. Evernote can identify 28 typewritten and 11 handwritten languages. You can also choose which language is used by changing the Recognition Language setting.</p>
 <br></br>
<li>Notebooks and Tags</li>
<p>Evernote makes it easy to collect notes in notebooks and add keyword tags, so you can find them again fast. Create a detailed organizational system or just use our powerful advanced search to find the notes you need by title, keywords, dates, or the kind of content they contain.</p>
<br></br>
<li>Document Scanning</li>
<p>Keep all your important papers with you whenever and wherever you need them: healthcare and insurance files, warranty and product information, invoices, receipts, and more. With Premium or Evernote Business, take a photo of any business card with your phone and you’ll never lose another name, phone number, or email address. You can even connect a card to the person’s LinkedIn profile automatically.</p>
 <br></br>
<li>PDF and Document Search</li>
<p>Evernote’s Premium and Business plans let you search PDFs, Office docs, images, presentations, and scanned documents in an instant. No matter how basic or granular your search, you can find text buried deep inside PDFs, words in handwritten notes, or details from scanned business cards.</p>
</ul>  

        <h6><a id="Advantages">Advantages</a></h6>
            <ul>
<li>Evernote is useful for managing all sorts of different personal and professional online aspects of your life. If you use a computer at work and a computer at home, accessing files from each machine through Evernote is much easier than emailing it to yourself or saving it to a USB every time you update it.</li>
     <br></br>
<li>Since Evernote automatically syncs everything up between your devices whenever you upload something new or make any changes to your notes or files, you're not limited to working with just one machine for storing everything. And because it's designed to be a complete virtual filing system that makes finding any individual notebook, note or another type of file easily, you never have to worry about saving something on your computer and then forgetting where you saved it.</li>
 <br></br>
<li>You can use Evernote for something as simple as a shopping list, which you could create on a computer and later access from your smartphone when you’re shopping. Alternatively, you could use Evernote for business purposes by sharing files and collaborating on projects with colleagues.</li>
</ul>
